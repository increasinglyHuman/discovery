Good morning. Alvin Toffler. Toffler famously said something like - in the future the illiterate will be those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Is that quote from future shock? Today, I will plan to make a video, it will be a video that focuses in a constructive way on this idea - but with some positive reframe. We'll likely be a little creative - and we'll likely use some tool to help lure learners to our hook - an interactive activity is always fun, the video might prove helpful.

This is actually a fantastic rabbit hole and perfect fodder for your video. The attribution story is more interesting than people realize.

The famous quote as people know it — "The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn" — is widely attributed to Toffler but it's not actually in Future Shock in that form.
Playable
What is in Future Shock (page 271) is Toffler quoting psychologist Herbert Gerjuoy, who said something closer to: tomorrow's illiterate will not be the man who can't read, but the man who has not learned how to learn.
Playable
And just before that passage, Toffler himself wrote about instructing students how to learn, unlearn and relearn. The polished version people quote appears to come from Rethinking the Future (1997), a compilation edited by Rowan Gibson where the Tofflers contributed a few pages.
Future

So it's a mashup — Toffler's "learn, unlearn, relearn" language fused with Gerjuoy's "illiterate of the future" framing, compressed into one clean bumper sticker over decades of re-quotation. That misattribution story itself is a beautiful meta-example of the quote's own point: we need to unlearn what we think we know about the quote to relearn its actual origin.

Now — for your video. I love where you're heading with the positive reframe. The original framing is deficit-based (you're illiterate if you can't do this), which is a stick. Your instinct to flip it into something constructive and lure learners in with an interactive hook is the carrot.

A few directions we could go with the interactive element:

One approach: build a short self-assessment artifact — something like "What's Your Learning Agility Score?" where viewers can rate themselves on learn/unlearn/relearn dimensions and get a personalized result. That gives you a call-to-action in the video ("try the tool linked below") and generates engagement.

Another angle: a before/after reframe tool where learners type in a belief or assumption they hold, and the artifact walks them through a structured unlearn-relearn cycle — almost like a mini cognitive flexibility exercise.

Or we could go more playful — a "Knowledge Expiration Date" concept where you present common assumptions and let people guess which ones are already outdated, turning the unlearning concept into a game.

What's pulling you? And what's your target audience for this — your Adobe Learning Summit crowd, your broader LinkedIn following, or the Learning Guild community?

Gerjouy's quote is actually better - it is more fundamental - and yes - exactly my point - it's not a positively framed concept. who is the modern philosopher who has spoken extensively on the concept of frames .... i think it's a George someone.
6:04 AM

George Lakoff — the cognitive linguist at UC Berkeley. His whole body of work is about how frames shape thought before people even engage with the content. Don't Think of an Elephant is the one everyone knows, but Metaphors We Live By (with Mark Johnson) is the deeper foundation.

His core argument is exactly what you're circling: the frame is the message. Toffler/Gerjuoy framed adaptive learning as avoiding illiteracy — a threat frame. And per Lakoff, once that frame is activated, you're already fighting uphill because the audience is processing through fear and deficit rather than possibility and agency.

So if you reframe Gerjuoy's idea through a Lakoff lens, you're not just putting a positive spin on it — you're fundamentally changing which cognitive structures get activated in the learner. "The most capable people of the 21st century" versus "the illiterate of the 21st century" trigger completely different neural pathways before a single piece of content is consumed.

That's a powerful one-two punch for your video: here's this famous quote everyone gets wrong (the attribution hook), and here's why it's framed wrong (the Lakoff lens), and here's what it looks like when we get the frame right (your reframe + the interactive tool).

Are you thinking of building this around a specific reframed version of the quote, or do you want to let the audience discover the reframe through the interactive piece?

target is linked in community. Think 3 minute video with pointer to an interaction online - the concept - the power of the paradigm shift. Holding multiple frames and doing honest appraisal. Critical thinking - vs. conspiracy thinking - how does anyone in the chaos stream of memes, conventional wisdom, active disinformation, constant marketing sensationalism, and the frenzy of click baiting, maintain critical thinking skills, and embrace change and new knowledge with an open heart and mind. Why this ... is the primary skill that will separate the successful (both personally and professionally) as we surf the current transformation.
6:17 AM

That's a hell of a throughline, Allen. You're essentially arguing that Gerjuoy's "learning how to learn" was the right seed, but the 2026 version is something more like cognitive sovereignty — the ability to hold multiple frames simultaneously, do honest appraisal, and choose your response rather than getting hijacked by whatever frame hits your amygdala first.

And the chaos stream you're describing — memes, disinfo, clickbait, marketing sensationalism — that's not just noise. It's a frame war. Every piece of content arriving in someone's feed is trying to install a frame before the person can think. Lakoff would say most people don't even know they're being framed. The skill you're pointing at is noticing the frame before it captures you.

The conspiracy thinking vs. critical thinking distinction is the sharp edge of this. They look similar on the surface — both question official narratives, both claim to "do their own research." But the mechanism is opposite. Critical thinking holds frames loosely and follows evidence. Conspiracy thinking locks a frame and filters evidence to fit. One is cognitively flexible, the other is cognitively rigid wearing the costume of independence.

For a 3-minute video structure, something like:

Open with the famous Toffler quote — then pull the rug. It's misattributed. The real version is better. And both of them got the frame wrong. (That's your hook — 30 seconds, and you've already demonstrated unlearning in real time.)

Middle — the Lakoff pivot. Here's why frames matter. Here's the chaos stream we're all swimming in. Here's the difference between critical thinking and conspiracy thinking (they're not the same rebellion). The real skill isn't learning or unlearning — it's recognizing which frame you're inside before you react.

Close — the positive reframe and the CTA. Point them to the interactive tool. Something that actually gives them the experience of frame-shifting rather than just telling them about it.

For that interactive piece — I'm thinking something that presents the same information through different frames and lets people feel the shift in their own cognition. Like presenting a real scenario (an AI replacing jobs, a policy change, a scientific finding) and showing how different frames completely change the interpretation — then asking the learner to construct their own frame. That's the muscle. Not consuming the right frame, but building the capacity to generate and evaluate frames consciously.

Want me to start building that interactive artifact? I could prototype something that walks people through a frame-shifting exercise — maybe 3-4 scenarios where they experience how the same data feels completely different depending on the lens.

I love your passing mention of the amygdala taking hold here - learning to recognize 'triggers' emergent from past trauma - is a clear fundamental at play - fear seems to be among the larger mechanisms working to inspire the 'independent thinking conspiracist. Emotionally triggered a person can easily look toward oppositional models, and quickly lock one in because of that instinctive (likely amygdalar drive to break free of a trap) - noting the fundamental difference between evidence based learning, holding onto multiple models while evaluating them as a roadmap is a clear model - teachable skill.
6:26 AM

Yes — and you've just identified something that almost nobody in the learning space is willing to say out loud: that the conspiracy-to-critical-thinking spectrum isn't primarily an intellectual problem. It's a nervous system problem. The amygdala doesn't care about your epistemology. It fires, and then your prefrontal cortex goes shopping for justification.

That fight-or-flight-or-frame-lock sequence is exactly what you're describing. Someone encounters information that triggers a sense of threat — could be economic anxiety, identity threat, loss of control, past trauma — and the amygdala screams get out of the trap. Oppositional framing feels like escape. It feels like agency. And the moment that single frame clicks into place and the anxiety drops, the brain rewards itself. Now you're not evaluating evidence anymore — you're defending a position that your nervous system has coded as survival.

That's why conspiracy thinking feels so much like courage to the person inside it. The somatic experience is real. The relief is real. The sense of "I see what others don't" is genuinely rewarding neurochemically. It's just that the cognitive flexibility got sacrificed for the emotional regulation.

And here's where your reframe gets really powerful: you're not saying those people are stupid or broken. You're saying they're using a real cognitive capacity — pattern recognition, questioning narratives, seeking agency — but it's been hijacked by an unregulated threat response. The skill you're teaching isn't "think better." It's "notice when your nervous system has grabbed the steering wheel, and build the capacity to hold the discomfort of uncertainty long enough to actually evaluate."

That's the teachable skill: distress tolerance in the presence of ambiguity. Holding multiple models while your limbic system is screaming at you to pick one and defend it. That's not just critical thinking — that's a somatic and cognitive integration skill.

For the video, this gives you an incredibly human entry point. You're not lecturing people about media literacy. You're saying — your brain is doing something natural, and here's how to work with that mechanism rather than being captured by it. The trigger recognition piece is the foundation. If you can't notice the activation, you can't interrupt the frame-lock.

And for the interactive tool, this suggests something that goes beyond just showing different frames. What if it actually induces a mild frame conflict — presents something that feels true from one angle and wrong from another — and then gives people the metacognitive scaffolding to notice what's happening in their own response? Not just "look at these two frames" but "notice which one your gut grabbed first, and sit with the other one for a moment."

That's the muscle you're training. Not information processing — frame tolerance.

Should I start building this? I'm seeing something that combines the Gerjuoy/Toffler attribution reveal, the Lakoff framing lens, the amygdala mechanism, and then drops them into an experience where they actually practice holding competing frames. Could be a clean React artifact with a few carefully designed scenarios.

this is ultimately the core nature of ambiguity tolerance. perhaps there is a better way to frame tolerance for ambiguity to make it seem sexier - and design a kind of mini game around it. perhaps ambiguity tolerance itself, is the sword and shield, map and compass of the puzzle solver - what's that word for people who solve puzzles?
6:29 AM

Enigmatologist! Though that's technically someone who creates puzzles. The solver side doesn't have as clean a word — which is almost a design opportunity.

But you're onto something with the adventure metaphor. Ambiguity tolerance framed as intellectual adventure gear rather than a clinical psychology term completely changes the energy. Nobody wants to be told they need more "tolerance for ambiguity." Everybody wants to be an explorer navigating uncharted territory.

What if the reframe is something like Cognitive Wayfinding? Or leaning into the puzzle-solver identity more directly — you're not tolerating ambiguity, you're navigating it. The ambiguity isn't the problem to endure, it's the terrain where all the interesting discoveries live.

The sword and shield / map and compass metaphor is strong because it implies that ambiguity is a landscape you move through with the right tools, not a condition you suffer. The conspiracist grabbed one map and stopped exploring. The critical thinker carries multiple maps and keeps cross-referencing against the actual terrain.

For a mini-game — what about something like a wayfinding challenge where you're presented with a claim or scenario and you have to collect evidence fragments that support competing interpretations, and your score isn't based on picking the right answer but on how many valid frames you can hold simultaneously before committing? The longer you can resist premature closure while still actively reasoning, the higher you score. You're literally gamifying the muscle of staying in the uncertainty.

You could call it something like The Wayfinder's Challenge or Frame Runner — something that sounds like a game, not a psychology exercise.

Want me to start prototyping this? I could build a working version that you could link from the video — a few rounds of scenario-based frame-holding with a scoring mechanic that rewards cognitive flexibility over speed-to-answer.

this is an excellent direction - let's run with it - but let's drain it of the intellectualism and design it for the mind of a 6th grader. Discovery - perhaps we imagine some case in which the player is the first to learn about this particular place or thing. it could imagine an interstellar voyage, exobiology, or investigations into some unknown fantasy realm.
6:40 AM

Yes — discovery context is perfect. When you're the first human to encounter something genuinely new, there is no existing frame. You have to hold multiple interpretations because nobody's been here before. That strips away all the political and cultural baggage and puts the player in a state of pure curiosity.

Exobiology is brilliant for this because nothing maps to prior assumptions. You find a structure on an alien world — is it a plant? A building? A creature? A tool? The 6th grader doesn't feel like they're being taught critical thinking. They feel like they're an explorer making first contact decisions where jumping to conclusions could mean missing something amazing — or making a dangerous mistake.

The scoring mechanic writes itself: you're a scout sending reports back to the ship. If you lock in a single interpretation too early, your report is narrow and you miss discoveries. If you hold multiple hypotheses and gather more evidence before committing, your report is richer and you earn Explorer rank. The game rewards curiosity stamina — how long can you keep wondering before you need to know.

And the emotional hook for a 6th grader is that the alien stuff is cool and weird. They want to keep exploring because the next piece of evidence might reveal something even stranger. The ambiguity isn't uncomfortable — it's the fuel for adventure.

Let me build this. I'm thinking 3-4 encounters on an alien world, each presenting something ambiguous with evidence fragments you collect, multiple possible interpretations you can track, and a discovery score based on how many viable hypotheses you maintained before your final report.
