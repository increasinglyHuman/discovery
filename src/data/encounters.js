  `Your report on the crystalline basin has been transmitted to Earth. It will arrive in 112 years. For now, you're on your own — the first human to document alien biology. Your instruments are picking up anomalous readings to the north. Something else is out there.`,
  `Two sites. Same biochemistry. Your chief science officer pulls up the atmospheric data and frowns. "There's something in the upper atmosphere I dismissed as background noise during approach. Look at these readings." The pattern is complex. And it's everywhere.`,
  `Three connected systems. Your navigator overlays the atmospheric data with a topographic scan and goes quiet. Then: "Captain — look at the equatorial plains." Thousands of lights are moving below. Rivers of them, flowing between every site you've mapped. Something is alive down there. Something big.`,
  `Your geologist has been studying the migration stream's eastern branch. She's found cave openings — and what's inside has changed her understanding of everything. "The walls aren't just rock," she says. "They're pages." You need to see this yourself.`,
  `Every reading has changed. The pulse. The columns. The signal. The migration routes. All of them — simultaneously. Your chief science officer sets down her coffee and says what everyone is thinking: "It knows we're here." The question is what that means.`,
